# Simple command line utility to update your software
The code is very small, but I also wanted to try some basic shell scripting.
Requires root privileges because a regular user cannot update regular apps installed using apt; if you don't trust me, it's okay, you can review the code yourself.

## Will update:
* Apts
* Flatpaks

# Requirements:
* Fastfetch (can be removed by editing the code)
* Root privileges (to update APTs)
* Flatpak installed on your system

# Download "Update.sh" and run it in the terminal
